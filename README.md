Donation System

## Objective
This Java Swing Application aims to bring together the individual donors and the organization that accepts and the donation accepting organization in order to facilitate the collection and distribution of donation. 

## Problem Overview
The existing system of donation is manual and scattered. Tracking the database is hard if the details are maintained manually. We aim to develop an application where people can donate blood, organs, food, money and/or utilities using a single application. Donor from different locations can choose their donation method and receiving NGO by just filling a registration form and confirming the details provided. 

## Application Key Functionalities
* Rather than limiting the system for a single type of donation this application will be capable of accepting donation such as blood, organs, money, food, clothes and other utilities.
* We aim to design a scalable system so that type of donation, Number of participating organization and location of warehouses can be increased easily as and when required.
* Donors will be receiving updates about their donation status through email.

## Additional Features
* Donor can send organ donation request directly to hospital.
* Lab test will be conducted in order to check whether there is no preexisting disease to the donor and only after approval, donation request will be updated.
* Mail will be sent to donor in order to keep them notified whether they are eligible for donation or not.
